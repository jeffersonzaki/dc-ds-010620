## Summary
Tasked with creating a pitch deck to Microsoft using broken, incomplete, zipped data files that were given in a csz.gz and tsv.gz format. 

After choosing the best data to use, it is then made into a dataframe, combined, and cleaned.
The dataframes that were extensively used/manipulated, will be created into 4 data visualizations that will be represented to Individuals with a non-technical background.

You are able to find project instructions, all of the data that was to be used(located in the "Data" file), a technical notebook of all the listed actions and though process that were taken(two separate files that were being worked on by the two project members), and a pitch deck that represents our data with to a non-technical viewer.
